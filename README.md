# Readme
**If your goal is simply to test out the functionality of the app disregarding the GUI and watermarks. Simply run the **map.html** file in your IDE to open the map in your local browser (i.e. Chrome, Firefox). All functions of the app should work accordingly, it just won't look that good.**





In order to **fully access** the app(within the JxBrowser), you need to perform the following actions:
  1. Go to this link [https://teamdev.com/jxbrowser/#evaluate](url) and request a free trial (for an access key)
  2. Afterwards, download the required package (named **jxbrowser-7.28.1-cross-desktop-win_mac_linux-20230724T053332Z-001.zip**)
  3. Import all the files from this project into your local IDE (preferably IntelliJ and attach the downloaded package(above) as a dependency)
  4. Replace the activation key existing within my code with the code you just requested from [https://teamdev.com/jxbrowser/#evaluate](url)
  5. Go into [https://console.cloud.google.com/](url) and request an API key
  6. Go into the **map.html** file and replace the API existing within the code with the API key you just requested
  7. "TA-DA!" Now run the java class titled **MapScreen.java** and you should have a fully functioning app.
